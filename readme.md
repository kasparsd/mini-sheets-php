# MiniSheets

Extremely minimal and limited PHP library for creating the most basic Office Open XML and Microsoft Excel XLSX files.

Created as a learning excerise for creating the most basic possible XLSX file. See [this blog post for the origin story](https://kaspars.net/blog/excel-xlsx-xml-php).


## Requirements

- [`ZipArchive`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.ziparchive.php) for creating XLSX files which are actually ZIP files (TODO: add support for any ZIP library).


## Usage

Install it as a Composer dependency:

	composer require kasparsd/mini-sheets-php

See examples for how to use it.
